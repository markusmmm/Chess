\maketitle
Starting with what went well this time around, what really stood out was the possibility to get help from each other through Discord. The biggest reason for this is that every team member has been available on the chat pretty much alwas, meaning communication outside of the meetings has not been a problem at all. The team in general find this to be a trait that has become, and one which we want to stay.\\\\
Another thing that has very well is the Trello board. The Trello board has a complete overview of all tasks and problems. It acts as a TODO list and also as a log of everything that has been done. At the start we emphasized heavy on setting up the Trello board, which in turn gave us a well fleshed out task board. As the project went on, the team has been very diligent with adding tasks and problems that occurs, so the board was more or less always up to date with the current progress.\\\\
Going over what didn't work out as expected, number one thing was the identification of problems and tasks to be done, more specifically the size of the tasks. We took for granted the size of the tasks we distributed among each other. We originally planned to do planning poker, but we totally forgot about it and just started coding right away. We also realized it too late that we should have divided the big tasks into smaller tasks. This is something we have to remember for the next assignment and have to utilize planning poker.\\\\
Another thing that did not work as expected was actually partially the Trello board. While the Trello board gave us a good overview of the project, the team was not diligent with tagging themselves on the cards and such. A few of us also started to make small changes here and there in other files which we had not tagged ourselves on. Both of these points resulted in changes that were not known, and albeit not big and fatal, merge conflicts happened. We want to be stricter with the tagging convention onwards to avoid these unecessary merge conflicts.
