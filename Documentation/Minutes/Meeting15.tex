\section*{Notes taken under meeting}
Looked at feedback\\
Had to add licensing for code we wrote. MIT licensing seemed to fit our purpose well, so we went with it\\
Had to fix sequence diagram. Markus redid it and re-explained for the rest of the team\\
Mikael started to suspect that several methods were trying to edit the same hash key at the same time, which turned out to be true. Started making a mutex to solve this problem.\\
After messing around abit with Heroku, turns out it did not fit our perpose, so Magnus started to look at other solutions\\
Pawn promotion needs to take care of user input somehow. Need graphical pop up so player can choose what piece to transform the pawn to.
