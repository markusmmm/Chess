\section*{Notes taken under meeting}
Current progress:\\
- Jan suggest we switch to Stockfish because our current code causes too many bugs and problems we are not able to fix in time. Implemented Stockfish and all AI difficulties worked perfectly.\\
- Markus fixed pawn promotion entirely. Works with pop up where the player can choose which piece to transform the pawn to.\\
- Magnus made highscores fully functionally.\\
- Hints were implemented\\
- Updated documentations; team plan, sequence diagrams, class diagrams\\
- Created powerpoint and demo\\\\
Retrospective:\\
- Workflow has been good. Planning poker gave us a better start\\
- Communication is still on point, but team members can be better to ask for help\\
- Get better at explaining own code for the rest of the team\\
- Use of Trello has improved
