\section*{Notes taken under meeting}
Current progress so far:\\
- ConurrentModificationException does not happen anymore, but not possible to move any pieces\\
Check and check mate not really working properly either. Problem lies in the king checking of the possible moves of all enemy pieces so the player cannot put the king in check.\\\\
Also need to start looking at castling and pawn promotion\\
Jan is appointed to test writer, working on tests to find faults in code\\
Markus started implementing ranking\\\\
Magnus and Viet looking into database stuff\\
- Heroku looked promising
