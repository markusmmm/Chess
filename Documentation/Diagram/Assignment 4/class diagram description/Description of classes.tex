The board class is the "controller" of our program. First and foremost it creates a standard, 8*8, chess board with white and black pieces put in the right coordinates. Board keeps track of which alliance turn it is, and which piece that was moved last. Board also executes the moves, based on users input. The users input is retrieved by GameBoard, based on which tile the user clicks on. Board uses this input to move pieces, but first board has to check that this move is legal. Every chess piece has defined rules on how to behave within their own classes. We have named these methods legalMove, which decides if a piece can move to a given destination. Every piece also has a method which returns all possible destinations as a list of vectors. \newline
