Overall feedback
Very good job!

In this delivery you perform very well, there is just some minor things that should have been put a bit more effort into. 

You should have updated the user manual to incorporate the new changes (The new features) and the retrospective is too short and really reflects too little.
The retrospective from this iteration is one of the things that always comes on the exam so please before then - Think some more about what went good, what went bad, how would you fix the problems you faced etc. 
There are also some problems from previous iterations that are not fixed yet. (Promoting for instance) 
Also if you play a local vs game you are as white able to take the black king without the game ending.
Again these are just minor things.You did a good job and we hope you had fun in this course. 

Score: 84 (of 100)
